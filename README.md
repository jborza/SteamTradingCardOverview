# SteamTradingCardOverview

A tool to generate an overview of how many Steam trading cards are there available in your account.

Reads pasted contents from "badges" page - e.g. http://steamcommunity.com/id/USERNAME/badges/ from the standard input and generates a comma separated list of games and number of remaining steam trading cards. 

Sample output:

    "Grow Home",1  
    "Mad Max",3
    
I personally then merged this with the data from http://steam.tools/cards/ - great work, guys!
